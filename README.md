##### Fiscal Harmony is a Personal Finance Management System designed to help users manage their finances by calculating income, tracking expenses, and creating budgets. It offers three key features: a budgeting tool for smart financial planning, an Emergency Fund Calculator for preparing for unexpected financial situations, and detailed financial reports. The system currently uses C++ with libraries like iostream, cmath, and limits.

##### Now, Fiscal Harmony is being upgraded and converted into Java with additional features, including income and expense tracking, a history log for past transactions, and a dedicated terminal. It will also incorporate a database, such as .csv files, to save and manage user data.
